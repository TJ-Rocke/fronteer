      Hey {firstName}, My name is Thomas â€” I'm the creator of Fronteer. I
      started Fronteer because I struggled to prepare for Frontend interviews. A
      simple and effective process that just works. Why did you sign up? What
      brought you here? Hit "Reply" and let me know. I read and reply to every
      email. Looking forward to talking to ya, Thomas
    </p>
