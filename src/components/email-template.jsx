      My name is Thomas â€” I'm the creator of Fronteer.
      <br />
      <br />I started Fronteer because I struggled to prepare for Frontend
      interviews. A simple and effective process that <i>just works</i>.

      Hit "Reply" and let me know. I read and reply to every email.
      <br />
      <br />
      Take care,
      <br />
      Thomas
