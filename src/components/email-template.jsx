      My name is Thomas â€” I'm the creator of Fronteer.
      <br />
      <br />
      I'm starting Fronteer because I struggle to prepare for Frontend
      interviews. Just having a simple and effective process that{" "}
      <i>just works</i>. I think putting together the right community and tools
      can make that happen.
